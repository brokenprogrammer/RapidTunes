# RapidTunes

A music player that lets you play music from many sources. The goal of RapidTunes is to let you collect all your music from various sources in one application.

## Deprecated

RapidTunes was a project started around when i started studying at LNU. This was a side project I used to learn programming on my spare time. The idea was to allow the user to build playlists with songs from different soruces such as spotify, youtube and soundcloud.

The player was built using a webview that would load in custom made html files with javascript used to connect to for example spotify and play the correct song.

We got as far as to play music from YouTube as well as local files using our own custom Flac file parser and audio player.

The code conventions, formatting, comments and tests makes this project in my opinion quite impressive in regards to where I was in my programming career at the time. There is many lines of code which today I would consider waste like getters & setters but there are also parts that still I find intriguing like the Flac parser and player.

We had big plans for this project and even tried to start a business around the idea contacting business counselors at the university who tried the application and wanted to nomiate us for an innovation award. We were in touch with Spotify employees trying to get a foot in the door there to get some help as well which was a very educative process.

I don't quite remember why the development stopped but I do remember we had some problem that we couldn't figure out a solution for with one of our integrations which is pretty sad. I still look back at this project from time to time since its still something I want to complete.

Will perhaps go for it sometime in the future.
